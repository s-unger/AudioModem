## Audio Modem
#### (Transfer encrypted data via standard telephone line or speakers and microphone.)
* Background:
    * Currently many states are trying to isolate their citizens from the web by blocking internet traffic.
    * Due to this, the citizens might need to fall back to telephone lines.
    * Those telephone lines could be monitored by the states secret service
    * To allow private communication even when there is no packet transfer anymore, this app uses old modem-style, but encrypted data transfer.
* Description:
    *   Chat or send/receive various data.
    *   No need for internet wifi or cellular network, just speakers and microphone.
    *   Data is transfered using sound waves on frequencies adult human ear can't hear.

* More about project:
	*	Uses frequency modulation (key-shifting) to send data.
	*	Encoding done with adaptive Huffman.
	*	Error correction done with Reed Solomon's algorithm.
